## Day 1 - The Developer Experience 
<br/>

## cf push Automates Developer + Operator workflows 

### Automation, not Support Tickets

### So what happens after you execute the "cf push" cli command?: 
1. Uploads your code
2. Detects and installs required runtime and middleware (“Buildpacks”)
3. Sets up a route (or URL)
4. Creates a load balancing entry
5. Creates SSL termination
6. Creates health monitoring and logging subsystems
7. Starts your app in a healthy state, with the desired number of instances
8. Binds specified backing services

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>


## Let's Compare Deployment Tasks!
### Once code is complete and tested, what do you have to do to get to prod?

<br/>


## Dockerfiles:  Typically the most common way developers get started with containers.


###  1. It's a good starting point for most
###  2. Descriptive file specification (YAML)
###  3. It's pretty flexible

<br/>


```
FROM somewhere/ubuntu
MAINTAINER Anonymous Person <Anonymous.Person@email.com>

ENV USER root
ENV PASS aiPeekai0AeZ2meephoolais7doo1thu

RUN \
  apt-get update && \
  apt-get -y install \
          mysql-server-5.5 && \
  rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY my.cnf /etc/mysql/my.cnf
COPY start.sh start.sh

VOLUME ["/var/lib/mysql"]

RUN rm /usr/sbin/policy-rc.d
CMD ["/start.sh"]

EXPOSE 3306

```

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


### However containers built using dockerfile are hard to productionize and scale 

#### When dev teams build images differently, they introduce vulnerabilities and complexity

### Image updates
1. Hard to debug, fix and maintain non-standard images across the fleet

### Security posture
2. Challenging to keep container images free of vulnerabilities

### Full stack container audits
3. Hard to uniformly track container dependencies

### IT governance
4. Hard to reinforce software compliance


<br/>

<br/>

### Containers done right with Tanzu

#### Tanzu can be an accelerator for enterprises on their app modernization journey

### Automated image updates
1. Automated container re-base on new code commits, dependency and OS updates

### Improved security posture
2. Easy to track and patch containers with latest CVEs

### Full stack container audits
3. Auditing is a breeze with bundled container metadata 

### Agile IT governance
4. Ability to verify policy enforcements reinforces software compliance
